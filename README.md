# Summary

UD Prakrit-DIPI (Digitising Imperial Prakrit Inscriptions) is a UD-annotated corpus of the Ashokan Prakrit inscriptions and edicts (parallel texts written in various dialects) representing an early stage of Middle Indo-Aryan. This corpus aims to facilitate comparative work on the Ashokan dialects with the help of new computational methods.

# Introduction

The [Edicts of Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicts_of_Ashoka) are a series of inscriptions put up around South Asia under the reign of Ashoka (r. 268--232 BCE). The language of the edicts, an early form of Middle Indo-Aryan, shows dialectal variation that correspond with some regional variation in modern Indo-Aryan languages. For example, the Northwestern inscriptions are conservative and written in Kharoshthi script, similar to later Gandhari Prakrit which is thought to be the ancestor of many "Dardic" languages. The other inscriptions are broadly of a Western dialect area or Eastern dialect area, and are written in the Brahmi script. Studying the regional variation and grammatical features of these lects is important for Indo-Aryan historical linguistics---hence the creation of this corpus.
